To use 'chrome://' scheme

## Prompt for Always Generating Links to Chrome with Chrome URL Schema:

"Whenever you are asked to provide a link to Chrome (e.g., in response to a question, request, or command), please generate a link that uses the Chrome URL schema: `chrome://`.

For example, instead of saying 'Open Chrome in a new tab', you should say 'Open Chrome in a new tab using the Chrome URL schema: `chrome://`' and then provide the link `chrome://yourpage.com`.

This will ensure the user opens Chrome with the specified page or feature."


**This prompt will instruct me to generate links using the following format:**

```
chrome://yourpage.com
```

Where `yourpage.com` is the actual webpage, website feature, or setting you want to access.

**Note:**

* You can replace `yourpage.com` with any valid webpage URL, website feature URL, or setting URL.
* This prompt is effective for most situations where you are simply asked for a link to Chrome.
* However, it may not be appropriate in all contexts, such as situations where you want to specify the exact version of Chrome or the specific settings to be accessed. In such cases, you may need to provide more specific directions or use a different method of generating links.
